# Dotnet Service in a MSA
> #### A sample todo list API that uses DDD methodology and implements on top of Clean Architecture pattern principles

Tests haven't been implemented yet, it will be much nicer when you have them! 🙂

I intend to build in this project a base structure for the implementation of microservices in .net, following the best practices of clean code and SOLID. It also intends to include some basic microservice capabilities, such as shared authentication support, logging, health check endpoint, and more.

Feel free to suggest improvements! 🤘🏿🙂
